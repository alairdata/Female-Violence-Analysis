# Female-Violence-Analysis
The data was downloaded from Kaggle containing a survey of men and women in African, Asian, and South American countries, exploring the attitudes and perceived justifications given for committing acts of violence against women.The data also explores different sociodemographic groups that the respondents belong to, including: Education Level, Marital status, Employment, and Age group.

It is, therefore, critical that the countries where these views are widespread, prioritize public
awareness campaigns, and access to education for women and girls, to communicate that
violence against women and girls is never acceptable or justifiable.
